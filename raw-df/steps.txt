Steps:

1.  Create a docker container (ubuntu) with just ssh, no python installed, 
    note down the ip address. check ../sshd/Dockerfile1, on how this 
    container is created, notedown the root passwd (balajiv)

      docker run --name srvr -d -t ubssh
      docker ps  -a
      docker inspect -f  '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' srvr

2.  Manually login to the system using ssh with the found ip address, make sure 
    ssh works. 
      ssh root@172.17.0.2 

3.  Make sure there is no python installed in the system, or through ssh
      docker exec -i -t srvr 'python --version'

4.  Create 'hosts' file with the ip address
5.  Create root_passwd.yml file, copy it as root_passwd_orig.yml
6.  Execute the commands as listed in root_passwd.yml, encrypted password file
    is created
8.  Create 'ansible.cfg' to disable host key checking
7.  Write a simple raw_df.yml, to login using ssh login and execute 
    'df -h' on the remote host (srvr)
